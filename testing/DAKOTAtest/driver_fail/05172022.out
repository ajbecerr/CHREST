ERROR: architecture is not defined. Accepted values: ia32, intel64

Syntax:
  source mklvars.sh <arch> [MKL_interface] [mod]

   <arch> must be one of the following
       ia32         : Setup for IA-32 architecture
       intel64      : Setup for Intel(R) 64 architecture

   mod (optional) - set path to Intel(R) MKL F95 modules

   MKL_interface (optional) - Intel(R) MKL programming interface for intel64
                              Not applicable without mod
       lp64         : 4 bytes integer (default)
       ilp64        : 8 bytes integer

If the arguments to the sourced script are ignored (consult docs for
your shell) the alternative way to specify target is environment
variables COMPILERVARS_ARCHITECTURE or MKLVARS_ARCHITECTURE to pass
<arch> to the script, MKLVARS_INTERFACE to pass <MKL_interface> and
MKLVARS_MOD to pass <mod>
